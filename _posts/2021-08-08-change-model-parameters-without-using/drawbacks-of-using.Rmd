# Introduction

Often, after creating a mizer model, you will want to make changes to the model
parameters, either to improve the model or to investigate the effect of changes.
For example you might want to study the community consequence of changes in the
physiology due to warmer waters, or whatever your research question is.

Mizer makes this very easy. However, it is important to use the right syntax. In
particular, one should avoid the use of the `@` symbol, as I will explain in
this blog post. So this post serves as a reminder of how one can make changes to
a model after it has been created.

As you will know, all the parameters describing a mizer model are contained in
an object of class MizerParams. You may either have created this object
yourself, for example with the `newMultispeciesParams()` function, or received
it from a colleague. Such an object has many slots holding the various pieces of
information about the model.

There are often two ways of accessing these slots. One involves the use of the
`@` symbol, the other uses a dedicated mizer function. If you look at the mizer
code, you will see a lot of `@` symbols. However I will discuss the potential
pitfalls when using the `@` symbol and advocate for the use of dedicated
functions that mizer provides for the purpose of changing model parameters.

This blog post was written with mizer version 2.2.1.9001

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(mizer)
packageVersion("mizer")
```

Throughout this post we will use the `NS_params` MizerParams object that comes
as an example with the mizer package.

```{r}
params <- NS_params
```


# Species parameters

Let's start with the `species_params` data frame. This holds species-specific
parameters that are used by mizer to calculate physiological rates according
to specific assumptions about the size-dependence of these rates. (The details
do not concern us here, but you can find all the information on the 
[help page](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/species_params.html) 
of `species_params()`. These size-dependent rates are then stored as large
arrays in the slots of the MizerParams object, to be efficiently used during
model projections. But also the species parameters are stored, and can therefore
be used to recalculate the rates when some species parameters change.

You can get the species parameters out of a MizerParams object in two ways,
both giving identical results:

```{r}
# Using function
sp <- species_params(params)
# Using @
spa <- params@species_params
# These are identical
identical(sp, spa)
```

The fact that these are identical is not surprising if you look at the code
for the `species_params()` function:

```{r}
species_params
```

The function actually only contains one statement, which accesses the
`species_params` slot using the `@` notation.

The difference between the two notations becomes apparent only when you want to
make a change to the species parameters. Let's assume we want to change the `h`
parameter for the first species in our example model. It currently has the value

```{r}
species_params(params)$h[1]
```

As you know, this parameter `h` is used to calculate the maximum intake rate
$h(w)$ as a power-law function of size: $h(w) = h w^n$. So for example the
maximum intake rate at the smallest size is

```{r}
getMaxIntakeRate(params)[1, 1]
```

Now let's increase the value of the `h` parameter using the `@` notation:

```{r}
params@species_params$h[1] <- 20
```

If we look at the maximum intake rate, we see that it has not changed:

```{r}
getMaxIntakeRate(params)[1, 1]
```

All we have done is change the value in the species parameter data frame, but
this did not trigger a recalculation of the maximum intake rate. We should 
instead have used

```{r}
species_params(params)$h[1] <- 20
```

Take a look at the syntax, which is really a bit weird when compared to other programming 
languages. If you want to dig deeper into this, a good place to look is
https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#replacement-functions.

This way of changing $h$ does indeed change the maximum intake rate:

```{r}
getMaxIntakeRate(params)[1, 1]
```

The reason is clear if we look at the code:

```{r}
`species_params<-`
```

So three things actually happen when you change a species parameter via the
setter function: 

1. Your new value is checked for validity
2. Your new value is saved in the `species_params` slot
3. The other slots in the MizerParams object are updated by calling `setParams()`.



# Gear parameters

Similar comments apply to the gear parameters. The gear parameters are used by
mizer to set up the catchability and selectivity arrays. You can find more
details on the 
[help page for setting fishing](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setFishing.html#setting-fishing).
You can get the current gear parameters in two equivalent ways:

```{r}
# Using function
gp <- gear_params(params)
# Using @
gpa <- params@gear_params
# These are identical
identical(gp, gpa)
```

But if you want to actually change the selectivity or catchability by
changing the gear parameters you need to use the functional form. 
Here is the current `gear_params` data frame in the example model:

```{r}
gear_params(params)
```

If, for example, we want to reduce the catchability of Sprat with the Industrial
gear to 0.8 we would do

```{r}
gear_params(params)$catchability[1] <- 0.8
```

Note that changing gear parameters in the `species_params` data frame will
__not__ have the desired effect. You need to change them in the `gear_params`
data frame.


# Resource parameters

Not surprisingly, the same applies to the resource parameters. These are used to
set up the size-dependent carrying capacity and replenishment rate for the
resource. You should access them with

```{r}
resource_params(params)
```

and change them with, for example,

```{r}
resource_params(params)$r_pp <- 4
```


# Rate arrays

When you call `newMultispeciesParams()`, then mizer uses the information in
`species_params`, `gear_params` and `resource_params` to set up various
arrays that will later make it much faster to run simulations of the model.
If you are not happy with how mizer fills these arrays, you can also
change them directly. And again you can do that either with `@` notation or
without.

Let's take the example of the maximum intake rate $h(w)$ that we already
discussed earlier. This is stored in the `intake_max` slot of the MizerParams
object, as a two-dimensional array, with one row for each species and one column
for each size bin. You can get at this way in the two equivalent ways:

```{r}
identical(getMaxIntakeRate(params), params@intake_max)
```

You may wonder, why the function is called `getMaxIntakeRate()` rather than
`intake_max()`, and I am wondering too. Naming things is difficult, and I now
think that I made a bad choice when choosing those names. It gets worse when
we now look at the syntax for changing `intake_max`. 

We can either do it with
the `@` notation, for example

```{r}
params@intake_max <- 2 * params@intake_max
```

or we can do it without `@` notation

```{r}
params <- setMaxIntakeRate(params, intake_max = 2 * getMaxIntakeRate(params))
```

This is ugly, and in future versions of mizer I think we will also allow

```{r eval=FALSE}
intake_max(params) <- 2 * intake_max(params)
```

But for now we are stuck with the functions that are all listed on the 
[help page] for `setParams()`. Note that these functions do not modify the
params object in place, but create a new MizerParams object, which we then
have to assign to a variable. 

Again there are benefits in avoiding directly accessing the slot with `@`.
These are:

1. The new value you assign is checked for validity. If you make a mistake in
an assignment using `@` you will not get any warning and instead will run
into mysterious and cryptic error messages later.

2. The new value gets protected from automatically being overwritten when you
make changes to other parameters.

We illustrate the second point with a simple example. Let's set one entry in the
`metab` slot, which holds the size-dependent metabolic rates, to a particular
value.

```{r}
params@metab[1, 1] <- 2
params@metab[1, 1]
```

Let us then make a totally unrelated change, say by changing the reproductive
efficiency of the 5th species and look again at our entry in `metab`.

```{r}
species_params(params)$erepro[5] <- 0.1
params@metab[1, 1]
```
The reason for this is that the change in the species parameter has triggered
a recalculation of the rate arrays from the species parameters, overwriting
our manual change.

Now let's try the same with the proper way of changing the metabolic rate.

```{r}
metab <- getMetabolicRate(params)
metab[1, 1] <- 2
params <- setMetabolicRate(params, metab = metab)
```

Now this will not get overwritten when some other parameter changes.

```{r}
species_params(params)$erepro[5] <- 0.1
params@metab[1, 1]
```

The way that was done internally is by attaching a comment to the `metab`
slot.

```{r}
comment(params@metab)
```

You could have chosen a more informative comment, for example

```{r}
comment <- "Just changed the [1, 1] entry for test purposes."
params <- setMetabolicRate(params, metab = metab,
                           comment_metab = comment)
```

All that matters is that there is a comment. This also tells us how we can
un-protect a slot so that it can be auto-computed from the species parameters
again:

```{r}
comment(params@metab) <- NULL
```

```{r}
species_params(params)$erepro[5] <- 0.1
params@metab[1, 1]
```

# Summary

We have seen how to change species parameters, gear parameters, resource
parameters or other slots in a MizerParams object by using the appropriate
functions. You can find a complete 
[list of these functions](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/index.html#section-model-parameters) 
in the mizer reference pages. We discussed how this avoids the pitfalls that
arise when accessing slots directly with the `@` notation. I hope this will be
useful to you when you explore your own mizer model.
