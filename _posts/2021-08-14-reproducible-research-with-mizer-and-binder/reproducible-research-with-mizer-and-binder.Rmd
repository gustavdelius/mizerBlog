# Introduction

There is much benefit in sharing the code that allows others to reproduce your
research. Not only does it allow others to validate your results, it also allow
them to build on what you have already done. This has benefits for them, but
also for you because it increases engagement with your research and advances 
the entire field.

The fact that you are using mizer rather than coding everything from scratch
of course makes your research code much shorter and therefore much easier for
others to understand and extend.

In this blog post I will share my amazement at how easy it has become to share
your code. There are five easy steps:

1. Put your code into an R notebook and add a bit of explanation.

2. Make your R notebook together with any data files publicly available in a 
[GitHub](https://github.com) repository.

3. Publish your R notebook on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) so people can quickly
view it, nicely rendered.

4. Launch it on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) so that people can run
your code in their browser without having to install anything.

5. Let the world know.

Steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 will only take a couple of minutes each, if one knows how
to, so after reading this blog post there will be no excuse not to take those
steps. Obviously step 1 can take as long as you like, depending on how nicely
you like your code to be documented.

I'll talk about each step now. As an example I'll use code for reproducing the
results and figures of [@canales_regulation_2020]

# Put your code into an R notebook

You probably have a jumble of R script files with the code for setting up
your model and running your analysis. Now that you are done, it makes sense
to organise this code a bit. A nice way of doing that is to open a new
R notebook (the second entry on the "New File" menu in RStudio) and pasting
your code into R chunks (you create R chunks with Ctrl-Alt-I). Then in
between the R chunks you can put explanations of what the code is for.
The result will look something like 
[my example](https://github.com/sizespectrum/plankton-anchovy/blob/master/plankton-anchovy.Rmd)

In the example I modified the header to include a table of contents and to
limit the height of the figures:

```
---
title: "Regulation of fish stocks without ..."
output: 
  html_notebook:
    toc: true
fig_height: 4
---
```

You will want to load all the libraries you need in a setup chunk like

```{r eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(mizer)
library(magrittr)
library(plotly)
```

The first line ensures that your code in the R chunks will be included when
the notebook is typeset.

The explanatory text between the R chunks is using Markdown syntax. So for
example you create section headers with `#`, headers of subsections with `##`
and so on. You can include LaTeX equations with the usual syntax. So
`\(x^2\)` produces the inline expression \(x^2\) and `\[x^2\]` produces the
displayed equation \[x^2\]
For more information see the 
[R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
and the
[R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf),
both of which are accessible via 'Help -> Cheat Sheets` in RStudio.

If you have a rather large chunk of code, it may be a good idea to split it
into smaller chunks, with more explanation in between. Just put your cursor
at the place where you want to split the chunk and hit 'Ctrl-Alt-I'.

The advice is to not be too perfectionist. Just put in enough explanations so
that you yourself will still be able to remember in a year's time what you were
doing. You can always add more explanations for others later if there are
requests. The point is that just by having your code out there, people will be
more encouraged to engage with you if they are interested.


# Put your notebook on GitHub

I think it is fair to say that [GitHub](https://github.com/) has become the
most popular place to share research code. So if you do not have an account
there yet, sign up for free. Then create a new repository there for sharing
your notebook.

If you have not used Git and GitHub before, it will really pay off in the long
run for you to put in some time familiarising yourself with them and setting
things up nicely. For a short introduction I recommend the
[chapter on Git and GitHub](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html) in the "R packages"
book. Even though the book is about developing R packages, that chapter is
not restricted to that use case. For a longer introduction, I recommend
[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).

But if now you are in a hurry, you can also cheat and simply upload your
R notebook and your data files using the "Add file" button on your new GitHub
repository.



# Publish your R notebook on RPubs

Now that your notebook is on GitHub, it is accessible to others, but GitHub
does not display the typeset version of the notebook. For that you can use
[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/), which is a free hosting site for R notebooks. 

RStudio makes publishing on RPubs very easy: When you click on "Preview",
RStudio will open a new window with the preview of your rendered notebook, and
on that window at the top right there is a "Publish" button. Click that button
and then make sure to choose "RPubs" (rather than RStudio Connect). You'll be
guided through the process.

Doing that with my example notebook leads to 
[this](https://rpubs.com/gustav/plankton-anchovy). Note the "Code" button
at the top right of the notebook on RPubs. It allows people to conveniently 
download your code.


# Make it executable on mybinder.org

Now this step I think is amazing. It allows people to play with your code
without having to install anything. Take a look at what this looks like for
[my example](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sizespectrum/plankton-anchovy/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio).
Be a bit patient --- after a few seconds you will see RStudio open in your
browser. Click on "plankton-anchovy.nb.html" in the File pane and select
"Open in Editor". You will now be able to execute the code chunks as well
as modify them at will. In fact, you can do anything that you can do in your
local RStudio.

You have to only do three things to make
this magic possible:

1. Add a file to you repository called "install.R" which contains only an
`install.packages()` command for installing all the packages that your notebook
needs. 
[See my example](https://github.com/sizespectrum/plankton-anchovy/blob/master/install.R).
You will want to include at least

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("mizer", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```

but extend the list with any other packages that you load with `library()`
in your notebook. You can create this file straight on GitHub via the 
"Add file" button or you can do it locally and then push to GitHub.

2. Add a file to your repository called "runtime.txt" with yesterday's date in
the format `r-yyyy-mm-dd`.
[See this example](https://github.com/sizespectrum/plankton-anchovy/blob/master/runtime.txt)
This will have the effect of setting up the environment with the current version
of all packages. That means that if the packages change in the future, this
will not break your notebook. The reason I recommend using yesterday's date
rather than today's is that this feature uses the 
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine) snap shots and the snapshot
for today may not yet be available.

3. Create the URL for your binder. It will have the form
`https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your-github-username/your-repository-name/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio`
where you need to replace `your-github-username/your-repository-name` with 
your GitHub user name and repository name. For my example the URL is
(https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sizespectrum/plankton-anchovy/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio).


The first time you visit your binder URL, mybinder will take a long time to create 
a Docker image. When it is done, you will see an RStudio session running in
your browser, with the files from your GitHub repository available
in the Files pane. When people visit the URL after you they will not have to
wait so long because mybinder.org will be able to use the Docker image to start
the server more quickly.

Each time you make a change to your GitHub repository, mybinder will rebuild
the Docker image the next time someone visits the URL. To save the first
visitor from a long wait, you may want to visit the URL yourself each time
you push a change to your GitHub repository.


# Let the world know

You will probably want to put the URLs to your notebook on RPubs and to your
binder into the README.md file of your GitHub repository. You will want to
put the link to your GitHub repository into your published paper. 

And then you will want to let your social networks know. If you twitter about 
it, include `@mizer_model` in your post. Also, consider writing a summary of
your work for this blog. 

Last but not least, please email <mizer@sizespectrum.org>. We'll include your
publication in the [list of publications using mizer](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/dev/articles/publications.html).
